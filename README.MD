# Bind Shell  

A bind shell that opens up a listener on the victim machine and allows for the attacker to connect to it.

# Important  
The "cd" command is only a psuedo-command within Java due to the "cd" command being a built-in command of the shell
rather than an executable.  
  
This function of the pesudo-command is a bit buggy and still needs fixing and might cause the program to crash.

# Usage
Start the listener file on a victim computer and then run the client file to connect to it.
